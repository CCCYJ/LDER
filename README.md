A classification for RSVP-BCI 
This repository contains code to improve the classification performance for RSVP-BCI by 
enhancing ERP features. These codes are for the paper “LDER: A classification framework 
based on ERP enhancement in RSVP task”. Users employing the code in a publication 
should cite this paper. 

All codes were written in MATLAB 2018b 
“ERP_enhance_2” contains the code used to enhance ERP components 
“ERP_classification_Main” contains the code used to classify targets and non-targets by 
using STHCP method. 

Notes: 
Our codes need to run based on the EEGLAB, which can be found at 
https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php. Data need to be imported through eeglab and 
the format is N*T.
